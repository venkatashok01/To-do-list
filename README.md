# To-Do List Project

The To-Do List Project is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create and manage their to-do list by adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- Add Task: Enter a new task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the to-do list.
- Edit Task: Click the "Edit" button next to a task to modify its content.
- Remove Task: Remove a task from the list once it's completed or no longer needed.
- Data Persistence: The application saves the to-do list in the local storage, so tasks remain even after the page is refreshed.
